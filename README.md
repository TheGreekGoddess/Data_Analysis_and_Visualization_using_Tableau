# PHENOMENON: YEAR ON YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE MONTH OF JULY FROM 2013 TO 2020
## YOY % CHANGE ANALYSIS
Considering the data set starts in 2013, it is unsure if the spike in total rider was due to launch as 2014 saw a -43% drop. There has been a steady incline in overall rides YOY (Year On Year). Trip durations in 2020 are 48% higher YOY and could be due to users working-from-home and having more leisure time.

## GENDER AND USER ANALYSIS
Male users average at low to mid 50% of the overall users. 2020 recorded a -17% drop compared to the 2019 male users. The start times seem to be consistent across both genders. 2013 to 2019, data reflects a steep decline at 10:00 a.m. as compared to 2020. Male users have a slight dip while female and unknown users don't have a 10 a.m slope.

## DAY OF WEEK ANALYSIS
The weekends in summer tend to see lower overall rides as compared to the rest of the week and could be due to folks entertaining at home. Surprisingly Wednesdays tend to be the leading on all three criteria: total rides, miles traveled, and trip duration.

## BIKE ID ANALYSIS
Bike IDs 25806, 26136, 21148, 14602, and 24862 show an average of 5.5k miles traveled for 2016 and hence are omitted to prevent skewed visualizations. These five bikes reflect comparatively fewer miles in 2017. Bike ID 21148 has no data since 2017, so this bike may likely be decommissioned. 2013 does appear to be the year with the highest overall trips and miles traveled by Bike ID.

## STATION ANALYSIS
The overall unique station counts have almost tripled in 2020 as compared to 2013. West St & Chambers St. has the highest total rides for both start and end stations of all the years.

PHENOMENON: YEAR TO DATE 2020 MONTH ON MONTH ANALYSIS
MOM % CHANGE ANALYSIS
The overall rides for July through September (Quarter 3, 2020) are almost the same as January through June (Quarter 1 and 2, 2020). The users appear to be stepping out more often in the summer months and for longer ride durations and miles traveled.

## GENDER AND USER ANALYSIS
COVID shelter-in-place mandate was issued around mid-March and could be why the April numbers are the lowest for 2020. As users resumed their routines by May 2020, we see an incline in ridership across the board. While males dominate the user base, the female users have been witnessing a steady rise. Both males and female users age spans from 16 - 70. There are some outliers over 100 years in age and hence have been omitted.

## DAY OF WEEK ANALYSIS
Users tend to travel the most miles on Saturdays and the least on Mondays. I am not sure if there was an event that led to a sudden spike in user activity for total miles traveled on July 17th and 20th so, I omitted them.

## BIKE ID ANALYSIS
Bike IDs 40831 and 44683 shows 5,443 and 5,437 miles in July. Hence I have omitted these from the dataset as they're outliers. These bikes may most likely need repairs. The total ride counts by bike ID are lower in the first four months of the year than the following four months, which could be due to the COVID-related work-from-home mandate in early 2020.

## STATION ANALYSIS
Grove St PATH has the highest total rides for both start and end stations for 2020. It has about 4.5k female users and almost 2.5 times male users at 12k. Of all the start and end stations, only about 20% have recorded more than a cumulative of 10k rides so far. There appears to be twice the average number of subscribers as customers for the top 20 stations.

Perhaps once a vaccine is found, we may see these trends normalize.
